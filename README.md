"# Front-End-Final" 
"This is a simple project showcasing CRUD operations on an external API, primarily handling a Marine object. This is based around the fantasy tabletop rpg setting of Warhammer: 40k. The app also includes a page showcasing a List of Movies and Reviews, both custom made. The images were provided by my lovely wife, and I felt that the Components for the Movies, MovieList, Reviews, and ReviewList could be adapted to support commentary and clips of particular marines and their exploits within the setting"
